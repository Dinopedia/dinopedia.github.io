  "overview": "Tyrannosaurus rex is a dinosaur currently documented from Late Cretaceous (68â€“66 million years ago) in Western North America. Current interpretation suggests a carnivore feeding profile. It is typically classified as Theropod. Evidence quality for Tyrannosaurus rex is currently limited by specimen completeness and historical naming complexity. Dino-pedia tracks this taxon with conservative wording so future specimen-level studies can be integrated without overwriting uncertain claims.",
