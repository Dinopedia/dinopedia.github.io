  "overview": "Plateosauravus is a dinosaur currently documented from Late Triassic with uncertain geographic attribution. Its diet remains unresolved from currently published material. Its finer taxonomic placement is still under active review and may change as comparative datasets improve. Evidence quality for Plateosauravus is currently limited by specimen completeness and historical naming complexity. Dino-pedia tracks this taxon with conservative wording so future specimen-level studies can be integrated without overwriting uncertain claims.",

  "funFacts": [
    "Plateosauravus remains an active target for revision as new material is compared across related taxa.",
    "Dino-pedia marks uncertain claims explicitly so this article can be upgraded with specimen-level evidence."
