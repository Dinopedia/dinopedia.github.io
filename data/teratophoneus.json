  "overview": "Teratophoneus is a genus of tyrannosaurine theropod dinosaur that lived during the late Campanian age of the Late Cretaceous period, in what is now Utah. It contains a single known species, T. curriei, named in honor of paleontologist Philip J. Currie. It is known from an incomplete skull and postcranial skeleton recovered from the Kaiparowits Formation.",

  "researchContext": {
    "evidenceBase": "Teratophoneus is represented by published fossil material, but completeness and diagnostic overlap can limit high-confidence biological reconstruction.",
    "currentLimits": "Several ecological and life-history traits remain inferential rather than directly measured for this taxon.",
    "nextDataNeeded": "Priority evidence includes better-preserved cranial/postcranial overlap, robust stratigraphic control, and specimen-linked morphometrics.",
    "revisionOutlook": "Interpretation is expected to improve as new finds and reanalyses clarify taxonomy and anatomy."
  },
  "funFacts": [
    "Teratophoneus remains an active target for revision as new material is compared across related taxa.",
    "Dino-pedia marks uncertain claims explicitly so this article can be upgraded with specimen-level evidence."
