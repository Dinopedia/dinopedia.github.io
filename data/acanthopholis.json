  "overview": "Acanthopholis is a dinosaur currently documented from an uncertain time interval with uncertain geographic attribution. Its diet remains unresolved from currently published material. Its finer taxonomic placement is still under active review and may change as comparative datasets improve. Evidence quality for Acanthopholis is currently limited by specimen completeness and historical naming complexity. Dino-pedia tracks this taxon with conservative wording so future specimen-level studies can be integrated without overwriting uncertain claims.",
