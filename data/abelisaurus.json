  "overview": "Abelisaurus is a dinosaur currently documented from Late Cretaceous (about 72-66 million years ago) in Patagonia, Argentina (South America). Current interpretation suggests a carnivore feeding profile. It is typically classified as Theropoda, Abelisauridae. Evidence quality for Abelisaurus is currently limited by specimen completeness and historical naming complexity. Dino-pedia tracks this taxon with conservative wording so future specimen-level studies can be integrated without overwriting uncertain claims.",
