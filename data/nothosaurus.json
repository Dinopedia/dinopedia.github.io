  "overview": "Nothosaurus is a marine reptile currently documented from Middle Triassic (247-210 million years ago) in Europe, Asia. Current interpretation suggests a carnivore feeding profile. It is typically classified as Sauropterygian. Evidence quality for Nothosaurus is currently limited by specimen completeness and historical naming complexity. Dino-pedia tracks this taxon with conservative wording so future specimen-level studies can be integrated without overwriting uncertain claims.",

  "overview": "Nothosaurus was a semi-aquatic Triassic reptile often considered near the ancestry of later plesiosaurs.",
