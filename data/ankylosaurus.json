  "overview": "Ankylosaurus is a dinosaur currently documented from Late Cretaceous (68-66 million years ago) in Western North America. Current interpretation suggests a herbivore feeding profile. It is typically classified as Ankylosaurid ornithischian. Evidence quality for Ankylosaurus is currently limited by specimen completeness and historical naming complexity. Dino-pedia tracks this taxon with conservative wording so future specimen-level studies can be integrated without overwriting uncertain claims.",
