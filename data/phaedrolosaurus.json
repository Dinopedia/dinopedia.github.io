  "overview": "Phaedrolosaurus is a dinosaur currently documented from Early Cretaceous with uncertain geographic attribution. Current interpretation suggests a carnivore feeding profile. Its finer taxonomic placement is still under active review and may change as comparative datasets improve. Evidence quality for Phaedrolosaurus is currently limited by specimen completeness and historical naming complexity. Dino-pedia tracks this taxon with conservative wording so future specimen-level studies can be integrated without overwriting uncertain claims.",
