  "overview": "Allosaurus is a dinosaur currently documented from Late Jurassic (155-145 million years ago) in North America and possible Europe. Current interpretation suggests a carnivore feeding profile. It is typically classified as Allosaurid theropod. Evidence quality for Allosaurus is currently limited by specimen completeness and historical naming complexity. Dino-pedia tracks this taxon with conservative wording so future specimen-level studies can be integrated without overwriting uncertain claims.",
