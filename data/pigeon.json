  "overview": "Pigeon is a avian reptile currently documented from Holocene (living lineage tracing back to Mesozoic theropod ancestors) in Worldwide (domestic and feral populations). Current interpretation suggests a omnivore feeding profile. It is typically classified as Aves, Neornithes, Columbidae. Evidence quality for Pigeon is currently limited by specimen completeness and historical naming complexity. Dino-pedia tracks this taxon with conservative wording so future specimen-level studies can be integrated without overwriting uncertain claims.",
