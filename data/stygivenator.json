  "overview": "Stygivenator, also known as the \"Jordan theropod\" is a dubious genus of tyrannosauroid dinosaur from the Hell Creek Formation, the type species is Stygivenator molnari. Originally considered a species of Aublysodon, another dubious genus, and then a juvenile of Tyrannosaurus, its specific identity can not presently be determined due to its poor preservation making it impossible to rule out an identity as either a specimen of Tyrannosaurus or Nanotyrannus.",

    "evidenceBase": "Stygivenator is represented by published fossil material, but completeness and diagnostic overlap can limit high-confidence biological reconstruction.",
    "currentLimits": "Several ecological and life-history traits remain inferential rather than directly measured for this taxon.",

  "funFacts": [
    "Stygivenator remains an active target for revision as new material is compared across related taxa.",
    "Dino-pedia marks uncertain claims explicitly so this article can be upgraded with specimen-level evidence."
