  "overview": "Turiasaurus is a dinosaur currently documented from Mesozoic with uncertain geographic attribution. Current interpretation suggests a herbivore feeding profile. Its finer taxonomic placement is still under active review and may change as comparative datasets improve. Evidence quality for Turiasaurus is currently limited by specimen completeness and historical naming complexity. Dino-pedia tracks this taxon with conservative wording so future specimen-level studies can be integrated without overwriting uncertain claims.",

    "Turiasaurus remains an active target for revision as new material is compared across related taxa.",
