  "overview": "Thecodontosaurus is a genus of herbivorous basal sauropodomorph dinosaur that lived during the late Triassic period. Its remains are known mostly from Triassic \"fissure fillings\" in southern England. Thecodontosaurus was a small bipedal animal, about 2 m (6.6 ft) long. It is one of the first dinosaurs to be discovered and is one of the oldest that ever existed. Many species have been named within the genus, but only the type species Thecodontosaurus antiquus is seen as valid today.",

  "funFacts": [
    "Thecodontosaurus remains an active target for revision as new material is compared across related taxa.",
    "Dino-pedia marks uncertain claims explicitly so this article can be upgraded with specimen-level evidence."
