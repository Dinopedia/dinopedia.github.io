  "overview": "Velociraptor is a dinosaur currently documented from Late Cretaceous (75-71 million years ago) in Mongolia and nearby Asia. Current interpretation suggests a carnivore feeding profile. It is typically classified as Dromaeosaurid theropod. Evidence quality for Velociraptor is currently limited by specimen completeness and historical naming complexity. Dino-pedia tracks this taxon with conservative wording so future specimen-level studies can be integrated without overwriting uncertain claims.",
