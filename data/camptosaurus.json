  "overview": "Camptosaurus is a dinosaur currently documented from Late Jurassic in North America. Current interpretation suggests a herbivore feeding profile. It is typically classified as Ornithopod. Evidence quality for Camptosaurus is currently limited by specimen completeness and historical naming complexity. Dino-pedia tracks this taxon with conservative wording so future specimen-level studies can be integrated without overwriting uncertain claims.",
