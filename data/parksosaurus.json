  "overview": "Parksosaurus is a genus of neornithischian dinosaur from the early Maastrichtian-aged Horseshoe Canyon Formation of Alberta, Canada. It is based on most of a partially articulated skeleton and partial skull, showing it to have been a small, bipedal, herbivorous dinosaur. It is one of the few described non-hadrosaurid ornithopods from the end of the Cretaceous in North America, existing around 70 million years ago.",

    "evidenceBase": "Parksosaurus is represented by published fossil material, but completeness and diagnostic overlap can limit high-confidence biological reconstruction.",
    "currentLimits": "Several ecological and life-history traits remain inferential rather than directly measured for this taxon.",
    "nextDataNeeded": "Priority evidence includes better-preserved cranial/postcranial overlap, robust stratigraphic control, and specimen-linked morphometrics.",
    "revisionOutlook": "Interpretation is expected to improve as new finds and reanalyses clarify taxonomy and anatomy."
  },
  "funFacts": [
    "Parksosaurus remains an active target for revision as new material is compared across related taxa.",
    "Dino-pedia marks uncertain claims explicitly so this article can be upgraded with specimen-level evidence."
