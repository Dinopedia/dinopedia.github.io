  "overview": "Stegosaurus is a dinosaur currently documented from Late Jurassic (about 155-150 million years ago) in North America. Current interpretation suggests a herbivore feeding profile. It is typically classified as Stegosaurian ornithischian. Evidence quality for Stegosaurus is currently limited by specimen completeness and historical naming complexity. Dino-pedia tracks this taxon with conservative wording so future specimen-level studies can be integrated without overwriting uncertain claims.",
