  "overview": "Brachiosaurus is a dinosaur currently documented from Late Jurassic (about 154-150 million years ago) in North America. Current interpretation suggests a herbivore feeding profile. It is typically classified as Brachiosaurid sauropod. Evidence quality for Brachiosaurus is currently limited by specimen completeness and historical naming complexity. Dino-pedia tracks this taxon with conservative wording so future specimen-level studies can be integrated without overwriting uncertain claims.",
=======
  "overview": "Brachiosaurus was a giant long-necked sauropod known for its forelimbs being longer than its hindlimbs, giving it a high-shouldered profile adapted for high browsing.",
