  "overview": "Diplodocus is a dinosaur currently documented from Late Jurassic (about 154-150 million years ago) in North America. Current interpretation suggests a herbivore feeding profile. It is typically classified as Diplodocid sauropod. Evidence quality for Diplodocus is currently limited by specimen completeness and historical naming complexity. Dino-pedia tracks this taxon with conservative wording so future specimen-level studies can be integrated without overwriting uncertain claims.",

  "overview": "Diplodocus was a long, whip-tailed sauropod from Late Jurassic North America, adapted for low-to-mid browsing and efficient long-distance movement.",
