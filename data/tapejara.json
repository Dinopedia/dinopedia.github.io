  "overview": "Tapejara is a aerial reptile currently documented from Early Cretaceous (112 million years ago) in South America. Current interpretation suggests a omnivore feeding profile. It is typically classified as Pterosaur. Evidence quality for Tapejara is currently limited by specimen completeness and historical naming complexity. Dino-pedia tracks this taxon with conservative wording so future specimen-level studies can be integrated without overwriting uncertain claims.",
