  "overview": "Phyllodon is a genus of small ornithischian dinosaur from the Late Jurassic (Kimmeridgian) Camadas de Guimarota Formation of Leiria, Portugal and possibly also the Middle Jurassic (Bathonian) Chipping Norton Limestone of England. It may have been closely related to contemporaneous ornithischian dinosaurs from North America. This genus is known from teeth and possibly partial lower jaws. The name is also in use for a genus of modern moss, but this is not considered to be a problem because the two organisms are in two different kingdoms.",

    "evidenceBase": "Phyllodon is represented by published fossil material, but completeness and diagnostic overlap can limit high-confidence biological reconstruction.",
    "currentLimits": "Several ecological and life-history traits remain inferential rather than directly measured for this taxon.",
    "nextDataNeeded": "Priority evidence includes better-preserved cranial/postcranial overlap, robust stratigraphic control, and specimen-linked morphometrics.",
    "revisionOutlook": "Interpretation is expected to improve as new finds and reanalyses clarify taxonomy and anatomy."

  "funFacts": [
    "Phyllodon remains an active target for revision as new material is compared across related taxa.",
    "Dino-pedia marks uncertain claims explicitly so this article can be upgraded with specimen-level evidence."
