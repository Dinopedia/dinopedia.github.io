  "overview": "Alvarezsaurus is a unknown currently documented from Late Cretaceous in South America. Current interpretation suggests a carnivore feeding profile. It is typically classified as Alvarezsaurid. Evidence quality for Alvarezsaurus is currently limited by specimen completeness and historical naming complexity. Dino-pedia tracks this taxon with conservative wording so future specimen-level studies can be integrated without overwriting uncertain claims.",
