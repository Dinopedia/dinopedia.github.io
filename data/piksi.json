  "overview": "Piksi is a aerial reptile currently documented from an uncertain time interval with uncertain geographic attribution. Current interpretation suggests a carnivore feeding profile. It is typically classified as Pterosauria. Evidence quality for Piksi is currently limited by specimen completeness and historical naming complexity. Dino-pedia tracks this taxon with conservative wording so future specimen-level studies can be integrated without overwriting uncertain claims.",
