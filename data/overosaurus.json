  "overview": "Overosaurus is an extinct genus of sauropod dinosaurs, containing only a single species, Overosaurus paradasorum. This species lived approximately 86 to 84 million years ago during the latter part of the Cretaceous Period in what is now Patagonia. Overosaurus paradasorum was relatively small compared to other sauropods from Patagonia, like the saltasaurids and other aeolosaurines, estimated as approximately 10 m (33 ft). It was a ground-dwelling herbivore.",

    "evidenceBase": "Overosaurus is represented by published fossil material, but completeness and diagnostic overlap can limit high-confidence biological reconstruction.",
    "currentLimits": "Several ecological and life-history traits remain inferential rather than directly measured for this taxon.",
    "nextDataNeeded": "Priority evidence includes better-preserved cranial/postcranial overlap, robust stratigraphic control, and specimen-linked morphometrics.",
    "revisionOutlook": "Interpretation is expected to improve as new finds and reanalyses clarify taxonomy and anatomy."
  },
  "funFacts": [
    "Overosaurus remains an active target for revision as new material is compared across related taxa.",
    "Dino-pedia marks uncertain claims explicitly so this article can be upgraded with specimen-level evidence."
