  "overview": "Ojoraptorsaurus is a dubious genus of oviraptorosaurian dinosaur from the late Cretaceous. Ojoraptorsaurus is only known from pubic bones found at the Naashoibito Member of the Ojo Alamo Formation dating to the late Maastrichtian, about 66 million years ago. It was first named by Robert M. Sullivan, Steven E. Jasinski and Mark P.A. van Tomme in 2011 and the type species is Ojoraptorsaurus boerei. The generic name combines a reference to the formation with a Latin raptor, \"plunderer\", and a Latinised Greek saurus, \"lizard\". The specific name honours oceanographer Arjan Boeré who found the specimen.",
