  "overview": "Tharosaurus is a dinosaur currently documented from Middle Jurassic in India. Current interpretation suggests a herbivore feeding profile. Its finer taxonomic placement is still under active review and may change as comparative datasets improve. Evidence quality for Tharosaurus is currently limited by specimen completeness and historical naming complexity. Dino-pedia tracks this taxon with conservative wording so future specimen-level studies can be integrated without overwriting uncertain claims.",

    "evidenceBase": "Tharosaurus is represented by published fossil material, but completeness and diagnostic overlap can limit high-confidence biological reconstruction.",
    "currentLimits": "Several ecological and life-history traits remain inferential rather than directly measured for this taxon.",

    "Tharosaurus remains an active target for revision as new material is compared across related taxa.",
    "Dino-pedia marks uncertain claims explicitly so this article can be upgraded with specimen-level evidence."
