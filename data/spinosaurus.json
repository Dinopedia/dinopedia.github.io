  "overview": "Spinosaurus is a dinosaur currently documented from Cretaceous (about 112-93 million years ago) in North Africa. Current interpretation suggests a piscivore/carnivore feeding profile. It is typically classified as Spinosaurid theropod. Evidence quality for Spinosaurus is currently limited by specimen completeness and historical naming complexity. Dino-pedia tracks this taxon with conservative wording so future specimen-level studies can be integrated without overwriting uncertain claims.",
